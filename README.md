# Student Performance Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This machine learning project predicts student performance based on study-related factors.
The goal is to analyze student data and classify outcomes using a supervised learning model.

The project includes complete steps from dataset usage to model evaluation and result visualization.


##  Dataset
The dataset contains student-related information such as:
- Study hours
- Attendance
- Previous performance
- Other academic features

The dataset is used directly for training and testing the machine learning model.



##  Machine Learning Workflow
- Data loading and inspection
- Feature selection
- Train-test split
- Model training
- Prediction on test data
- Model evaluation



##  Results and Evaluation
The model performance is evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- Classification Report

An *Actual vs Predicted graph* is generated to visually compare model predictions with actual outcomes.

Terminal output showing evaluation metrics is included in the repository.
